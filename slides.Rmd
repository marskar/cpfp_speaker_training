# Cancer Research
- So many questions
- So little time (and money)
- Prevention research can have tremendous impact
    - Catch cancer early
    - Before it becomes entrenched
    - More ðŸ’¥ for our ðŸ’°


---
# Data Collection methods
- Active
    - e.g. Trials and Observational Studies
    - Expensive
- Passive
    - e.g. Cancer registry
    - More ðŸ’¥ for our ðŸ’°

---
# Main question

How can we leverage cancer registry data to improve cancer risk prediction methods?

---
# Money slide

Map of the US with distribution of cancer risk.
